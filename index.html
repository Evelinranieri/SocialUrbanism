    <h3> How Medellin has changed using Social Urbanism Policy? </h3>
    <p id="subheader">  A city known as one of the most unequal and violent in the world, has been praised as an example of urban innovation. </p>

    <p id= "definition=">  Medellín put significant monetary investments into its poorer communities in an attempt to transform itself from one of the most notoriously violent places in the world into an innovative city of the future. Policies involved significant governmental investment in infrastructure and improved services for the poor, including cable cars, urban escalators, and the transformation of a rubbish dump into a garden. This ambitious approach has been credited with the city’s rebirth.

        <p> Social urbanism was a suite of policies that began in 2005, which included Integral Urban projects (PUI) the aerial cable cars – Metrocable, and the Library Parks.
        Mayor Sergio Fajardo developed a sharp vision, imaginatively approached the problem, and delivered concrete policies and projects to ‘change the city’s skin’.
        Social urbanism interventions have only delivered some quantifiable successes, but have been effective at restoring dignity to
        the dispossessed citizens of Medellin. </p>

      <figcaption> Public Transportation: El Metrocable de Santo Domingo </figcaption>

    <p id="definitiontrans"> The Metrocable was established to fill the mobility gap – building Line K to the northeast and Line J to the west – and to connect the comunas, via the Metro, to the economically prosperous downtown  Whereby providing an alternative to the buses, and the occasional taxi, operating on the comunas’ deficient road networks. The Metrocable was selected as it is affordable to construct and operate, affordable for users, technically simple, and minimises land acquisition.
